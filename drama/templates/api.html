# OAuth2

The OAuth2 authorization flow is used to enable users to authorize third-party applications to access their {{"SITE_NAME" | app_config}} account without having to provide their login information to the application.

This page explains how to obtain API application keys, how to prompt a user for authorization, and how to obtain and use access tokens. 

## Step 1: Create your Application

In the [apps tab of {{"SITE_NAME" | app_config}} settings](/settings/apps), fill in and submit the form to request new API keys. You will need:

* an application name
* a Redirect URI, or a comma-separated list of redirect URIs. May not use HTTP unless using localhost (use HTTPS instead).
* a brief description of what your application is intended to do

Don't worry too much about accuracy; you will be able to change all of these later.

{{"SITE_NAME" | app_config}} administrators will review and approve or deny your request for API keys. You'll know when your request has been approved when a client ID and secret appear in your application information.

DO NOT reveal your Client Secret. Anyone with your Client Secret will be able to pretend to be you. You are responsible for keeping your Client Secret a secret!

## Step 2: Prompt Your User for Authorization

Send your user to `https://rdrama.net/oauth/authorize`, with the following URL parameters:

* `client_id` - Your application's Client ID
* `redirect_uri` - The redirect URI (or one of the URIs) specified in your application information. Must not use HTTP unless using localhost (use HTTPS instead). 
* `state` - This is your own anti-cross-site-forgery token. We don't do anything with this, except give it to the user to pass back to you later. You are responsible for generating and validating the state token.
* `scope` - A comma-separated list of permission scopes that you are requesting. Valid scopes are: `identity`, `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete` and `vote`.
* `permanent` - optional. Set to `true` if you are requesting indefinite access. Omit if not.

If done correctly, the user will see that your application wants to access their {{"SITE_NAME" | app_config}} account, and be prompted to approve or deny the request.

## Step 3: Catch the redirect

The user clicks "Authorize". {{"SITE_NAME" | app_config}} will redirect the user's browser to GET the designated redirect URI. The following URL parameters will be included, which your server should process:

* `code` - a **single-use** authorization code.
* `state` - The state token from earlier.

Validate the state token. How you do this is up to you.

## Step 4: Exchange code for access token

Make a POST request to `https://rdrama.net/oauth/grant`. Include the following form parameters:

* `client_id` - Your application's Client ID
* `client_secret` - Your application's Client Secret
* `grant_type` - Set to the word "code"
* `code` - The `code` parameter that was given to you in the previous step.

Python example:

<pre>
	import requests
	code=request.args.get("code")

	headers={"User-Agent": "sex"}
	url="/oauth/grant"
	data={"client_id": my_client_id,
			"client_secret": my_client_secret,
			"grant_type": "code",
			"code": code
			}

	r=requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

	print(r.json())
</pre>

If everything is good, we will respond with the following (example) JSON body:

<pre>
	{
	"access_token": 		#Access token
	"scopes": 				#Comma-separated list of scopes included in authorization
	"expires_at": 			#Unix epoch integer time at which access token expires
	"token_type": "Bearer"
	"refresh_token":		#This key is omitted in temporary authorizations
	}
</pre>

Store the access and refresh tokens. You should also store expiration timestamp and the scopes list, so that you pre-emptively avoid sending requests to {{"SITE_NAME" | app_config}} that won't be accepted.

## Step 5: Using the Access Token

To use the access token, include the following header in subsequent API requests to {{"SITE_NAME" | app_config}}: `Authorization: Bearer access_token_goes_here`

Python example, presuming that the application has obtained a valid `read` authorization:

<pre>
	import requests

	headers={"Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token,
			 "User-Agent": "{{"SITE_NAME" | app_config}} Reader v1 by @carpathianflorist"}
	url="/"

	r=requests.get(url, headers=headers)

	print(r.json())
</pre>

The expected result of this would be a large JSON representation of the submissions that make up the user's personal front page.
